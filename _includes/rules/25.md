# 25.  FIRST AID

At all Competition matches, each Team is expected to provide someone who has attended an FA Emergency Aid course, or similar, within the last three (3) years.  Copies of the relevant Certificate should be provided to the Leagueâ€™s Child Welfare Officer, if so requested.

In addition, each Team must ensure that they have an up-to-date First Aid Kit with them at all Competition fixtures. Clubs failing to comply with this part of the Rule shall incur a fine as set-out in the Fines Tariff, increasing in multiples of the same for each subsequent offence.
