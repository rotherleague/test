# 30.  EVENING MATCHES AND ‘DOUBLE HEADERS’

When extreme fixture backlog occurs, the Competition’s Fixtures Secretary, after consultation with the Management Committee, will have the power to schedule evening fixtures, and/or ‘double headers’ if teams have not previously met during the Playing Season.

Such ‘double headers’, when arranged, shall be played as two separate matches immediately following one another on the same pitch, with a ten (10) minute break in between.  Notwithstanding the venue, each Team shall play one of these matches as its ‘home’ game and shall be responsible for reporting the match result, etc., on that basis.
