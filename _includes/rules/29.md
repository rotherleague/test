# 29.  USE OF ONLINE SYSTEMS

In order to improve the Competition’s operational efficiency and make it easier for Clubs and Teams to participate, the Management Committee is utilising various online systems to manage the Competition’s day-to-day operation.  

These include the FA Full-Time website, which is used by the Competition to set and publish fixtures, as well as for the reporting of match results and the submission of team sheets and referee marks, etc., by Clubs and Teams.  

In addition, entry forms for Clubs and Teams into the Competition are also handled via an online system.  

Any requirements set-out in the Standard Code of Rules regarding the provision of information to the Competition by Clubs and Teams shall therefore include the submission of such information via the relevant online systems, where so specified by the Management Committee.
